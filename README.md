Pandas Challenge Analysis

This challenge analyses on the performance of 15 schools in PyCity. Data consist of scores in math and reading, school type, school size and budget. From the data provided, we can determine how a school is performing base from the above factors.

After doing some data analysis. Pycity Schools gave interesting results.  First thing I noticed is the schools that spent less per student gave a better overall passing rate in Maths and Reading, which is surprising. As one would expect the other way. Secondly, the scores in smaller size schools has better performance than larger schools. And lastly, independent schools have better results than government owned.
